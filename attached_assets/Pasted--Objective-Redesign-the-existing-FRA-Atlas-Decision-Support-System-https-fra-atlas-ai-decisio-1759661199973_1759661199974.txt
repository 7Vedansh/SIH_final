🎯 Objective:

Redesign the existing FRA Atlas Decision Support System (https://fra-atlas-ai-decisio-ku4c.bolt.host/
) into a visually stunning, highly responsive, and government-grade professional portal, without altering or removing any backend functionalities, APIs, or map logic.

The goal is to deliver an interface that evokes trust, authority, and innovation—making the first impression unforgettable for judges, government officials, and end users.

🏛️ 1. Core Vision

Create a next-generation WebGIS Decision Support Portal that:

Reflects formal government aesthetics.

Maintains all current map layers, DSS tools, and functionalities.

Feels completely transformed visually — as if built from scratch.

Is accessible, responsive, and multilingual (EN | HI).

Demonstrates AI + GIS synergy elegantly through clean UI metaphors and visual storytelling.

🎨 2. Design & Aesthetics

Visual Tone:

Elegant and modern, yet official — inspired by government dashboards (like India Data Portal, PMGDISHA, MyGov).

Use soft gradients, glassmorphism, and neat elevation cards.

Balance beauty with simplicity — make it feel expensive and professional.

Color Palette:

Shades of royal blue, saffron, emerald green, and off-white backgrounds.

Accent colors for action buttons and highlights.

Maintain strong color contrast for accessibility.

Typography:

Use Noto Sans, Inter, or Poppins (with consistent hierarchy).

Readable on all devices; proper line spacing and alignment.

Animations:

Subtle transitions, hover glows, map-layer fades, button hover lift, etc.

Avoid unnecessary motion — maintain dignity.
